# APM Meeting Script - Talking Points

## Opening (2 minutes)
"Alvaro, I want to focus this conversation on building something valuable together. I've put together a specific proposal for APM Restaurant Group that connects directly to your bigger goals - including that Japan hotel acquisition."

**Hand over:** Executive Summary (1 page)

"The short version: We build a restaurant management system specifically for Ogawa, Hiyakawa, and Midorie that increases your monthly profit by $15,000-25,000, then scale it as a SaaS business. This creates both immediate value for APM and a technology asset that supports your broader hospitality vision."

## The Problem (3 minutes)
"Right now, each of your venues operates independently. You're missing opportunities to:
- Turn your guest data into repeat business across all locations
- Prevent no-shows that are costing you thousands monthly
- Cross-sell between venues - someone who loves Ogawa might not know about Hiyakawa
- Optimize operations with real-time data instead of gut feel"

**Specific numbers:**
"Industry average no-show rate is 15-20%. Even a 3-point improvement across your venues means $6,000-12,000 monthly in recovered revenue. That's $72,000-144,000 annually just from better reservation management."

## The Solution (5 minutes)
"Think of this as an amplified OpenTable built specifically for APM. One system that:

**Captures every guest interaction** - unified database across all three venues
**Prevents revenue loss** - deposit system and no-show prediction
**Drives cross-venue business** - automated marketing based on dining history
**Optimizes operations** - real-time dashboards for managers"

**Show the flow:**
"Customer dines at Ogawa → system captures preferences → automatically invites them to Hiyakawa's sake tasting → tracks conversion → measures ROI. All automated, all measurable."

## The Partnership (5 minutes)
"Here's what I'm proposing: 50/50 partnership in a new company, APM Tech LLC.

**You bring:** Capital, the three venues as anchor customers, industry credibility, business development
**I bring:** Complete technical development, project management, ongoing platform management

**Structure:** 4-year vesting, independent board member for tie-breaking, you maintain control of all guest data"

**Address ownership concerns:**
"Your guest data stays 100% yours. The technology platform is owned by our joint company. If this doesn't work out, you get all your data and can buy out the platform at fair value."

## The Pilot (3 minutes)
"Before any big commitments, let's prove this works with a 90-day pilot:

**$35,000 total investment, three milestones:**
- $12K: Integrate all your guest data into one system
- $12K: Launch deposit system and cross-venue marketing
- $11K: Run three marketing campaigns and measure results

**Success criteria we both agree on:**
- Capture 5% of diners with marketing consent
- Reduce no-shows by 3 percentage points
- Convert 2% of targeted guests to other venues
- Achieve 3x ROI on marketing campaigns"

**Risk mitigation:**
"If we don't hit at least two of those four targets, you get the final $11K back and keep everything we built."

## The Japan Hotel Connection (3 minutes)
"This isn't just about restaurants. This builds toward your $50M Japan hotel goal in three ways:

**Immediate cash generation** - $15K-25K monthly profit improvement at APM
**Scalable SaaS revenue** - License to other restaurant groups at $399/venue/month
**Hospitality technology IP** - Valuable asset for hotel operations

**Timeline connection:**
Year 1: Perfect the system across APM, start external licensing
Year 2: Scale to 40+ venues, launch hotel consulting using proven optimization methods
Year 3: Generate capital and operational expertise for Japan hotel acquisition"

## Addressing Objections (prepare for these)

**"I want to own the IP"**
"Two options: Either I license it to you with perpetual rights, or we do the 50/50 company where we both own the platform. Your guest data is always 100% yours regardless."

**"Too much money upfront"**
"We can start with just the $35K pilot. If it hits the targets, then we decide on the bigger partnership. Or we can do revenue sharing until the $35K is paid back, then move to the partnership model."

**"What if you leave?"**
"Four-year vesting with cliffs, plus you have step-in rights if milestones are missed. The company owns the IP, not me personally, so you're protected."

**"Why 50/50?"**
"Because we're both contributing essential elements. You're not just providing capital - you're providing the market, the credibility, the business development. I'm not just coding - I'm architecting, managing, and guaranteeing delivery. Equal risk, equal reward."

## The Close (2 minutes)
"Here's what I need from you today:

**Decision on the pilot:** $35K, 90 days, clear success metrics
**If you want the partnership:** Review the terms sheet and let's get legal docs started
**Timeline:** We can start within two weeks, first results in 6-8 weeks"

**Final positioning:**
"This isn't about building another app. This is about creating a technology asset that supports your vision of building a hospitality empire. The Japan hotel becomes much more achievable when you have proven restaurant optimization methods, scalable SaaS revenue, and valuable hospitality IP."

**Hand over:** Pilot SOW and Terms Sheet

"Take a look at these. The SOW covers the pilot in detail, the terms sheet outlines the partnership structure. Both are designed to be fair and protect your interests while moving fast."

## If He's Interested - Next Steps
1. "Let's schedule a venue walkthrough so I can see the current systems"
2. "I'll need 30 minutes with your managers to understand their pain points"
3. "Can we target [specific date] for pilot kickoff?"
4. "Who's your attorney for reviewing the partnership docs?"

## If He's Hesitant - Fallback Options
**Smaller pilot:** "We could start with just Ogawa for $15K to prove the concept"
**Consulting first:** "I could do a 2-week operational assessment for $5K, then propose solutions"
**Revenue sharing:** "Instead of upfront payment, we could do 50/50 revenue sharing on any improvements until you're comfortable"

## Key Messages to Reinforce
- **This is about your bigger vision, not just a software project**
- **Measurable results with clear success criteria**
- **Your data and control are protected**
- **Multiple exit options if it doesn't work**
- **Direct path to Japan hotel acquisition goal**
