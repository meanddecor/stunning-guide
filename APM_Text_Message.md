# Text Message to Alvaro

## Option 1: Direct and Business-Focused
"Alvaro - I've put together a specific plan for APM Restaurant Group that could add $15K-25K monthly profit across Ogawa, Hiyakawa, and Midorie while building toward your Japan hotel goal. 90-day pilot with clear ROI metrics, then potential 50/50 tech partnership. Can we meet this week to review? I have all the numbers and terms ready."

## Option 2: Shorter Version
"Quick plan for APM: Restaurant management system across all 3 venues, $15K-25K monthly profit increase, 90-day pilot for $35K with performance guarantees. Then scale as SaaS business supporting your Japan hotel acquisition. Free to review the proposal - when can we meet?"

## Option 3: Most Concise
"Built a restaurant optimization system specifically for APM venues. $35K pilot, guaranteed results, then 50/50 partnership scaling to SaaS. Connects directly to your Japan hotel plans. 30 min to show you the numbers?"

## Follow-up if No Response (24-48 hours later)
"Alvaro - the APM restaurant system proposal is time-sensitive due to other opportunities. The pilot ROI projections are strong and the partnership structure protects your interests. Worth 20 minutes to review together?"

## If He Asks for Details via Text
"Full proposal covers: unified guest database across venues, no-show prevention with deposits, cross-venue marketing automation, real-time operations dashboard. Pilot targets: 5% guest capture, 3pp no-show reduction, 2% cross-venue conversion, 3x marketing ROI. All documented with performance guarantees."

## If He Wants to See Materials First
"Sending you the executive summary and pilot SOW now. Key points: $35K pilot over 90 days, clear success metrics, your data stays yours, then option for 50/50 tech company with $150K Year 1 budget. Japan hotel connection explained in full proposal."

## Recommended Approach
Send **Option 2** first - it's specific enough to show you're serious but not overwhelming. If no response in 24 hours, send the follow-up. If he engages via text, keep responses short and push for an in-person meeting to review documents.
